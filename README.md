# **HouseWise 🏡**  
*A Machine Learning-powered house price prediction system*  

## 🚀 **Overview**  
HouseWise is a **machine learning model** designed to predict house prices accurately. Built using **Linear Regression**, the project optimizes model performance through **12 stages of data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering**. The final model is deployed using **Streamlit**, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface.  

## 🛠 **Tech Stack**  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn  
- **Optimization**: Grid Search CV  
- **Deployment**: Streamlit  

## 🔥 **Key Features**  
✔ **Data Preprocessing**: Extensive data cleaning, feature selection, and engineering  
✔ **Model Optimization**: Utilized **Grid Search CV** to fine-tune hyperparameters for better performance  
✔ **Feature Reduction**: Reduced feature set from **1300 to 246**, improving efficiency  
✔ **Interactive Web App**: Deployed with **Streamlit** for seamless user interaction  

## 🏗 **Installation & Setup**  
1. **Clone the Repository**
